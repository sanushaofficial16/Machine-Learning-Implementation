Problem Understanding

Predict car prices based on various features, helping a Chinese automobile company understand the factors that influence pricing in the American market. Business Goal: Develop a model to explain the pricing dynamics, aiding in car design and business strategy decisions for the US market.

Dataset Preparation

Data Loading: Import the CarPrice dataset containing car specifications and prices. Data Exploration: Perform an initial exploration to understand the structure of the data, identify any anomalies, and get a sense of potential relationships.

Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal). Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features (e.g., car brand, model) into numerical format using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding. Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure they are on the same scale, which is crucial for certain algorithms like SVR. Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (commonly 70-80% for training and 20-30% for testing).

Visualizations

Correlation Heatmap: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between features and the target variable (car price). Feature Importance Bar Chart: Display the importance of each feature using ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Model Performance Comparison: Create visualizations comparing the R-squared, MSE, and MAE of each regression model. Residual Plot: For the best-performing model, plot residuals to analyze prediction errors.

Model Implementation

Implement various regression models:

Linear Regression:
Start with a simple linear model to understand the basic relationship between features and car prices.

Decision Tree Regressor:
Implement a decision tree to capture non-linear relationships.
Random Forest Regressor:

Use an ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

Gradient Boosting Regressor:
Apply sequential ensemble learning to correct errors and refine predictions.
Support Vector Regressor (SVR): Implement SVR to fit data within a specified margin, optimizing the boundary for better predictions.

Model Evaluation

Performance Metrics: Evaluate each model using: R-squared: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Indicates the average squared difference between observed and predicted values. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Represents the average absolute difference between observed and predicted values. Best Model Identification: Identify the model with the highest R-squared and lowest MSE/MAE. In this case, the Random Forest Regressor emerged as the top-performing model.

Feature Importance Analysis Determine Key Variables: Analyze which features are most significant in predicting car prices using methods like feature importance scores from Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, along with correlation analysis.

Hyperparameter Tuning Objective: Optimize the best-performing model by tuning hyperparameters to improve performance. Techniques: Grid Search: Explore a predefined grid of hyperparameters. Randomized Search: Randomly sample hyperparameters to find the optimal combination

Final Results The Random Forest Regressor was found to be the most effective model for predicting car prices. The insights gained from feature importance analysis can guide the company in designing cars and forming business strategies tailored to the American market.

Overall Review:
This project successfully modeled car prices based on various independent variables, providing crucial insights into the factors influencing pricing in the American market. The use of multiple regression models allowed for a comprehensive analysis, with the Random Forest Regressor standing out as the most accurate predictor. Feature importance analysis highlighted the key variables that significantly impact pricing, which can inform strategic decisions for the company as they enter the US market. The hyperparameter tuning further refined the model, ensuring reliability and robustness in predictions.
